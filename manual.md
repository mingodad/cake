## Intro
Cake works as an extension for MSVC on Windows and as an extension for GCC on Linux. This approach makes Cake useful in real and existing programs.

When applicable, Cake uses the same command line options of MSVC and GCC.


## Include directories

On Windows, Cake can be used on the command line in the same way as MSVC. Cake will read the variable INCLUDE, which is the same variable used by MSVC to find the include directories. Additionally, you can run Cake outside the Visual Studio command prompt by adding the file 'cakeconfig.h' and specifying the directories using `pragma dir`.

To discover what directories are included, you can run the command 'echo %INCLUDE%' at Visual Studio command prompt.

```
echo %INCLUDE%
```


Copy this output to `cakeconfig.h`.
For instance:

```

#pragma dir "C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Preview/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.37.32820/include"
#pragma dir "C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Preview/VC/Auxiliary/VS/include"
#pragma dir "C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/include/10.0.22000.0/ucrt"
#pragma dir "C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10//include/10.0.22000.0/um"
#pragma dir "C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10//include/10.0.22000.0/shared"
#pragma dir "C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10//include/10.0.22000.0/winrt"
#pragma dir "C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10//include/10.0.22000.0/cppwinrt"

```

When cake runs it first tries to load cakeconfig.h, that must exist at same dir of cake.exe.

On Linux, the same file `cakeconfig.h` is used. To find out what are the directories used by GCC type

```
echo | gcc -E -Wp,-v -
```


Cake also includes standard header files. The objective is to allow usage even without installing GCC or MSVC. You can set this path on `cakeconfig.h` but mixing cake headers with other headers is not recommended.

## Command line

```
cake [options] source1.c source2.c ...

SAMPLES

    cake source.c
    Compiles source.c and outputs /out/source.c

    cake -target=C11 source.c
    Compiles source.c and outputs C11 code at /out/source.c

cake file.c -o file.cc && cl file.cc
    Compiles file.c and outputs file.cc then use cl to compile file.cc

cake file.c -direct-compilation -o file.cc && cl file.cc
    Compiles file.c and outputs file.cc for direct compilation then use cl to compile file.cc

```

### OPTIONS

#### -I  (same as GCC and MSVC)
Adds a directory to the list of directories searched for include files

####  -no-output
Cake will not generate output

#### -D (same as GCC and MSVC)
Defines a preprocessing symbol for a source file
#### -E (same as GCC and MSVC)
Copies preprocessor output to standard output

#### -o name.c (same as GCC and MSVC)
  Defines the output name. used when we compile one file

#### -remove-comments
Remove all comments from the output file

#### -direct-compilation
output code as compiler sees it without macros.

#### -target=standard
Output target C standard (c89, c99, c11, c2x, cxx)
C99 is the default and C89 (ANSI C) is the minimum target

#### -dump-tokens
Output tokens before preprocessor

#### -fi
Format input (format before language conversion)

#### -fo
Format output (format after language conversion, result parsed again)


#### -Wname -Wno-name  (same as GCC)
Enables or disable warnings.
See [warnings](warnings.html)


#### -showIncludes
Causes the compiler to output a list of the include files. The option also displays nested include files, that is, the files included by the files that you include.

#### -Wall
Enables all warnings

#### -sarif
Generates sarif files

#### -msvc-output
Output is compatible with visual studio IDE. We can click on the error message and IDE selects the line.

### -analyze
This option enables an static analysis of program flow. This is required for some
ownership checks

## Output

One directory called **out** is created keeping the same directory structure of the input files.

For instance:

```c
cake c:\project\file1.c
```

output:

```
  c:\project
  ├── file1.c
  ├── out
      ├── file1.c
```

More files..

```
cake c:\project\file1.c c:\project\other\file2.c
```

output

```
  c:\project
  ├── file1.c
  ├── other
  │   ├── file2.c
  ├── out
      ├── file1.c
      ├── other
          ├── file2.c
```

## Setting the path
This command is useful on windows to add the current path to system path. (This is not persistent)

```
set PATH=%PATH%;%CD%
```

## Pre-defined macros

```c
 #define __CAKE__ 202311L
 #define __STDC_VERSION__ 202311L
 #define __STDC_OWNERSHIP__ 1
```

The define __STDC_OWNERSHIP__ indicates that the compiler suports owneship checks

## C99 Transformations

C89 is the minimum target.

However the idea if C89 target is NOT support very old compilers, but generate code that can be compiled with C++.

C89
https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c89/c89-draft.html

C99
https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1124.pdf

```c
 #define __STDC_VERSION__ 199901L  //C99
```

### C99 restrict pointers

```c
void f(const char* restrict s);
```

Becomes in C89

```c
void f(const char* /*restrict*/ s);
```

N448

###  C99 Variable-length array (VLA)

The idea is not implement variable length arrays with automatic storage duration. (\_\_STDC\_NO\_VLA\_\_ 1).

But there are other uses of VLA.


```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int n = 2;
	int m = 3;
	int (*p)[n][m] = malloc(sizeof * p);

	printf("%zu\n", sizeof(*p));

	free(p);
}

```

Becomes C89 (not implemented)

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int n = 2;
	int m = 3;

    /*these variables are created to store the dynamic size*/
    const int vla_1_n = n;
	const int vla_1_m = m;

	int (*p)[n][m] = malloc((vla_1_n*vla_1_m)*sizeof(int));

	printf("%zu\n", (vla_1_n*vla_1_m)*sizeof(int));

	free(p);
}

```

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n683.htm

### C99 Flexible array members

```c
struct s {
    int n;
    double d[];
};
```

Becomes (not implemented)

```c
struct s {
    int n;
    double d[]; //?
};
```


### C99 static and type qualifiers in parameter array declarators

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void F(int a[static 5]) {
}

int main()
{
    F(0);
    F(NULL);
    F(nullptr);

    int a[] = {1, 2, 3};
    F(a);//error

    int b[] = { 1, 2, 3 , 4, 5};
    F(b);

    int c[] = { 1, 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6};
    F(c);
}

```

`static` is removed when target is < c99.

Cakes verifies that the argument is an array of with equal or more elements.

Cakes extend this check for arrays without static as well.

### C99 Complex and imaginary support
Not implemented

### C99 Universal character names (\u and \U)
TODO

###  C99 Hexadecimal floating constants

```c
double d = 0x1p+1;
```

Becomes in C89

```c
double d = 2.000000;
```

Cake converts the hexadecimal floating to decimal
floating point using strtod then snprintf.
That means this conversion is not precise.

### C99 Compound literals


```c
struct s {
  int i;
};

int f(void) {
  struct s * p = 0, * q;
  int j = 0;
  again:
    q = p, p = & ((struct s) { j++ });
  if (j < 2) goto again;
  return p == q && q -> i == 1;
}
```

Becomes in C89 (not implemented yet)

```c
struct s {
  int i;
};
int f(void) {
  struct s * p = 0, * q;
  int j = 0;
  again:
    struct s compound_literal_1 = { j++ };
    q = p, p = & compound_literal_1;
  if (j < 2) goto again;
  return p == q && q -> i == 1;
}
```
N716
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n716.htm

### C99 Designated initializers

```c
 int main()
 {
  int a[6] = {[4] = 29, [2] = 15 };

  struct point { int x, y; };

  struct point p = { .y = 2, .x = 3 }
 }

```

Becomes C89 (not implemented yet)

```c
int main()
{
  int a[6] = { 0, 0, 15, 0, 29, 0 };
  struct point { int x, y; };
  struct point p = { 3, 2 }
}
```

N494
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n494.pdf

### C99 Line comments
When compiling to C89 line comments are converted to
/*comments*/.

### C99 inline functions
TODO
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n741.htm

### C99 _Pragma preprocessing operator
TODO

### C99 \_\_func\_\_ predefined identifier
Parsed. C89 conversion not implemented yet.

###  C99 Variadic macros

We need to expand the macro when comping to C89.
This is covered by # macro expand.

Sample:

```c

#include <stdio.h>

#define debug(...) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)
#pragma expand debug

int main()
{
  int x = 1;
  debug("X = %d\n", 1);
}
```

Becomes

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define debug(...) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)
#pragma expand debug

int main()
{
  int x = 1;
  fprintf(stderr, "X = %d\n", 1);
}
```

I am considering to mark the debug macro to be expanded automatically
if \_\_VA\_ARGS\_\_ is used. Then pragma expand will not be necessary.

N707
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n707.htm


###  C99 \_Bool
When compiling to C89 _Bool is replaced by unsigned char.

```c
//line comments
int main(void)
{
    _Bool b = 1;
    return 0;
}
```

Becomes in C89

```c
/*line comments*/
int main(void)
{
    unsigned char b = 1;
    return 0;
}
```

Alternative design - typedef ?
Considering C23 has bool and the objective of C89 version is to have a version that compiles in C++ the best option would be use bool, true, false.

## C11 Transformations

```c
#define __STDC_VERSION__ 201112L //C11
```


https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1570.pdf

https://files.lhmouse.com/standards/ISO%20C%20N2176.pdf

###  C11 \_Static\_assert

When compiling to versions < C11 \_Static\_Assert is removed.

### C11 Anonymous structures and unions
TODO

### C11 \_Noreturn

```c
_Noreturn void f () {
  abort(); // ok
}
```

Becomes in < C11

```c
/*[[noreturn]]*/ void f () {
  abort(); // ok
}
```

C23 attribute [[noreturn]] provides similar semantics. The _Noreturn function specifier is an obsolescent feature

###  C11 Thread_local/Atomic
Parsed but not transformed.

###  C11 type-generic expressions (\_Generic)

When compiling to C99, C89 we keep the expression that matches the type.

For instance:

The expression that matches the argument 1.0 is **cbrtl**.

The result of \_Generic in C99 will be cbrtl. Because this is inside a macro we need to tell the transpiler to expand that macro using pragma expand.

N1441
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1441.htm

```c
#include <math.h>

#define cbrt(X) _Generic((X),    \
                  double: cbrtl, \
                  float: cbrtf , \
                  default: cbrtl \
              )(X)

#pragma expand cbrt

int main(void)
{
    cbrt(1.0);
}
```

Becomes in C99, C89

```c
#include <math.h>

#define cbrt(X) _Generic((X),    \
                  double: cbrtl, \
                  float: cbrtf , \
                  default: cbrtl \
              )(X)

#pragma expand cbrt

int main(void)
{
     cbrtl(1.0);
}
```

###  C11 u' ' U' ' character constants

//TODO

```c
 int i = U'ç';
 int i2 = u'ç';
```

Becomes in < C11

```c
 //TODO
 int i = ((unsigned int)132);
 int i2 = ((short)121);
```

Important: Cake assume source is utf8 encoded.

###  C11 u8"literals"

u8 literals are converted to escape sequences.

```c
char * s1 = u8"maçã";
char * s2 = u8"maca";
```

Becomes in < C11

```c
char * s1 = "ma\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3";
char * s2 = "maca";
```

N1488
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1488.htm

Important: Cake assume source is utf8 encoded.

### C11 _Alignof or C23 alignof

When compiling to C99 or C89 it is replaced by the equivalent constant.

```c
 int main()
 {
   int align = alignof(int);
 }
```

Becomes < C11

```c
 int main()
 {
   int align = 4;
 }
```

### C11 _Alignas or C23 alignas

Not implemented.

## C23 Transformations

https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3096.pdf

```c
#define __STDC_VERSION__ 201710L  //C17
#define __STDC_VERSION__ 202311L  //C23
```

###  C23 \_Decimal32, \_Decimal64, and \_Decimal128
Not implemented.

### C23 static\_assert / single-argument static_assert
In C23 static\_assert is a keyword and the text message is optional.

Whe comping to C11, static\_assert is replaced by it C11 version \_Static\_assert. If the static\_assert has only one argument the text becomes "error".

N1330
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1330.pdf

```c
int main()
{
    static_assert(1 == 1, "error message");
    static_assert(1 == 1);
}

```

Becomes in C11

```c
int main()
{
    _Static_assert(1 == 1, "error message");
    _Static_assert(1 == 1, "error");
}
```

In < C11 it is replaced by one space;

###  C23 u8 character prefix
Not implemented yet.
https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n2418.pdf

### C23 No function declarators without prototypes
https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n2841.htm

```c
int main(){
    func(); //this is an error in C23
}
```

### C23 Improved Tag Compatibility
Not implemented yet.

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3037.pdf

```c
struct foo { int a; } p;
void bar(void)
{
  struct foo { int a; } q;
  q = p;
}
```

Becomes < C23

```c
struct foo { int a; } p;
void bar(void)
{
  struct foo  q;
  q = p;
}
```

### C23 Unnamed parameters in function definitions

```c
int f(int );

int f(int ) {
}
```

https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n2480.pdf

Cake should add a dummy name when generating C < 23. (Not implemented yet)

### C23 Digit separators

```c
int main()
{
    int a = 1000'00;
}
```

Becomes in < C23

```c
int main()
{
    int a = 100000;
}
```

This transformation happens at token level, so even preprocessor and inactive blocks are transformed.

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2626.pdf

### C23 Binary literals

```c
#define X  0b1010

int main()
{
    int a = X;
    int b = 0B1010;
}

```
Becomes in C11, C99, C89

```c
#define X  0xa

int main()
{
    int a = X;
    int b = 0xa;
}

```


This transformation happens at token level, so even preprocessor and inactive blocks are transformed.

### C23 Introduce the nullptr constant

```c

int main()
{
  void * p = nullptr;
  auto p2 = nullptr;
  typeof(nullptr) p3 = nullptr;
}

```

Becomes in < C23

```
int main()
{
  void * p = ((void*)0);
  void  * p2 = ((void*)0);
  void  * p3 = ((void*)0);
}

```

https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3042.htm

### C23 Make false and true first-class language features

When compiling to C89 bool is replaced by unsigned char,  true by 1 and false by 0.

When compiling to C99 and C11 bool is replaced with **_Bool**, true is replaced with `((_Bool)1)`
and false with **(_Bool)0)**

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2935.pdf

###  C23 {} empty initializer

```c

int main()
{
    struct X {
        int i;
    } x = {};

    x = (struct X) {};

    struct Y
    {
        struct X x;
    } y = { {} };
}

```

Becomes in < C23

```c

int main()
{
    struct X {
        int i;
    } x = {0};

    x = (struct X) {0};

    struct Y
    {
        struct X x;
    } y = { {0} };
}

```

> Note: Cake code is 100% equivalent because it does not make padding bit zero.

###  C23 auto

```c
static auto a = 3.5;
auto p = &a;

double A[3] = { 0 };
auto pA = A;
auto qA = &A;
```

Becomes < C23

```c
static double a = 3.5;
double  * p = &a;

double A[3] = { 0 };
double  * pA = A;
double  (* qA)[3] = &A;
```

https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3007.htm


###  C23 typeof / typeof_unqual


```c

#define SWAP(a, b) \
  do {\
    typeof(a) temp = a; a = b; b = temp; \
  } while (0)

#pragma expand SWAP

int main()
{
    /*simple case*/
    int a = 1;
    typeof(a) b = 1;

    /*pay attention to the pointer*/
    typeof(int*) p1, p2;

    /*let's expand this macro and see inside*/
    SWAP(a, b);

    /*for anonymous structs we insert a tag*/
    struct { int i; } x;

   /*abstract declarator*/
   int k = sizeof(typeof(array));

   /*new way to declare pointer to functions?*/
   typeof(void (int)) * pf = NULL;
}

```

Becomes in < C23

```c

  do {\
    typeof(a) temp = a; a = b; b = temp; \
  } while (0)

#pragma expand SWAP

### C23 Improved Normal Enumerations

https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3029.htm

###  C23 constexpr

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3018.htm

Cake convert constexpr declarator with a cast and the value.
addressof constexpr declarator is not implemented.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

constexpr int c = 123;

int a[c];

constexpr double PI = 3.14;

static_assert(PI + 1 == 3.14 + 1.0);

int main()
{
   printf("%f", PI);
}

```

Becomes < C23

```c
#include <stdio.h>

const int c = 123;

int a[((int)123)];

const double PI = 3.14;

int main()
{
   printf("%f", ((double)3.140000));
}
```

TODO: Maybe suffix like ULL etc makes the code easier to read.

###  C23 Enhancements to Enumerations

```c
enum X : short {
  A
};

int main() {
   enum X x = A;
}
```

Becomes < C23

```c
enum X {
  A
};

int main() {
   short x = ((short)A);
}
```

#if __has_include(<any.h>)
#warning  YES
#else
#warning  NO
#endif

```
Its is implemented in cake.
Conversion < C23 not defined. Maybe a define.

###  C23 \#warning

When compiling to versions < 23 it is commented out.

```c
int main()
{
  #warning my warning message
}
```

When target < C23 becomes

```c
int main()
{
  /* #warning my warning message */
}
```

###  C23 \#embed

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  static const char file_txt[] = {
   #embed "stdio.h"
   ,0
  };

  printf("%s\n", file_txt);
}
```

Becomes in < C23

```c

https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3017.htm

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  static const char file_txt[] = {
    35,112,114,/*lot more here ...*/ 13,10
   ,0
  };

  printf("%s\n", file_txt);
}

```

I am considering add an option to generate a file with a suffix
like "embed_stdio.h" then the equivalent code will be:

Becomes in < C23

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  static const char file_txt[] = {
   #include "embed_stdio.h"
   ,0
  };

  printf("%s\n", file_txt);
}
```



###  C23 \#elifdef \#elifndef

```c
#define Y

#ifdef X
#define VERSION 1
#elifdef  Y
#define VERSION 2
#else
#define VERSION 3
#endif
```

Becomes < C23

```c
#define Y

#ifdef X
#define VERSION 1
#elif defined   Y
#define VERSION 2
#else
#define VERSION 3
#endif

```

###  C23 \_\_VA_OPT\_\_
Implemented.
Requires #pragma expand. (TODO make the expansion automatic)

```c

#define F(...) f(0 __VA_OPT__(,) __VA_ARGS__)
#define G(X, ...) f(0, X __VA_OPT__(,) __VA_ARGS__)
#define SDEF(sname, ...) S sname __VA_OPT__(= { __VA_ARGS__ })

## Cake Extensions (Not in C23)

###  Extension - try catch throw

```
   try-statement:
      try secondary-block
      try secondary-block catch secondary-block
```

```
jump-statement:
  throw;
```

try catch is a external block that we can jump off.

try catch is a **LOCAL jump** this is on purpose not a limitation.


catch block is optional.

```c
try
{
   for (int i = 0 ; i < 10; i++) {
      for (int j = 0 ; j < 10; j++) {
        ...
        if (error) throw;
        ...
      }
   }
}
catch
{
}
```

###  Extension - defer

*defer* will call the defer statement before the block exit at inverse order of declaration.

```
     defer-statement:
        defer secondary-block
```

For instance:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  do {
     FILE* f = fopen("in.txt", "r");
     if (f == NULL) break;
     defer fclose(f);

     FILE* f2 = fopen("out.txt", "w");
     if (f2 == NULL) break;
     defer fclose(f2);
     //...
  }
  while(0);
}
```

Becomes in C23, C11, C99, C89

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  do {
     FILE* f = fopen("in.txt", "r");
     if (f == ((void*)0)) break;

     FILE* f2 = fopen("out.txt", "w");
     if (f2 == ((void*)0)) {  fclose(f); break;}

     fclose(f2); fclose(f);
   }
  while(0);
}
```

###  Extension - if with initializer

No idea why C++ 17 if with initializer was not proposed for C23!
But in cake it is implemented.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   int size = 10;
   if (FILE* f = fopen("file.txt", "r"); f)
   {
     /*...*/
     fclose(f);
   }
}
```
Becomes

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
   int size = 10;
   {FILE* f = fopen("file.txt", "r");if ( f)
   {
     /*...*/
     fclose(f);
   }}
}
```

An extension if + initializer + defer expression was considered but not implemented yet.

C++ proposal
https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0305r0.html

###  Extension Literal function - lambdas

Lambdas without capture where implemented using a syntax similar of compound literal for function pointer.

Lambdas are the most complex code transformation so far because sometimes function scope types needs to be transformed to file scope. This is important because manual lambda capture
is something we want to use in function scope.

For instance:

```c
extern char* strdup(const char* s);
void create_app(const char* appname)
{
  struct capture {
     char * name;
  } capture = { .name = strdup(appname) };

  (void (void* p)) {
    struct capture* capture = p;
  }(&capture);
}
```
Because struct capture was in function scope and the lambda function will be created at file scope the type **struct capture** had to be moved from function scope to file scope.

```c
extern char* strdup(const char* s);

struct _capture0 {
     char * name;
  };

void _lit_func_0(void *p) {
    struct _capture0* capture = p;
  }

void create_app(const char* appname)
{
  struct _capture0  capture = { .name = strdup(appname) };
  _lit_func_0(&capture);
}
```

### Extension #pragma dir

```c
#pragma dir "C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10//include/10.0.22000.0/cppwinrt"
```

pragma dir makes the preprocessor include the directory when searching for includes.

### Extension #pragma expand

pragma expand tells the C back-end to not hide macro expansions. This is necessary when
the compiler makes changes inside the macro code.

Sample:


```c

#define SWAP(a, b) \
    do { \
      typeof(a) temp = a; a = b; b = temp; \
    } while(0)

#pragma expand SWAP

int main()
{
   int a = 1;
   typeof(a) b = 2;
   SWAP(a, b);
   return 1;
}
```

Becomes

```c
#define SWAP(a, b) \
    do { \
      typeof(a) temp = a; a = b; b = temp; \
    } while(0)

#pragma expand SWAP

int main()
{
   int a = 1;
   int b = 2;
    do {int temp = a; a = b; b = temp; } while(0);
   return 1;
}

```


### Type traits

We have some compile time functions to infer properties of types.

```c

_is_char()
The three types char, signed char, and unsigned char are collectively called the character types.

_is_pointer
Pointer to object or function

_is_array
Array type

_is_function
A function type describes a function with specified return type.

_is_floating_point
float, double, and long double return true

_is_integral
The standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types are collectively called the
standard integer types;

_is_arithmetic
Integer and floating types are collectively called arithmetic types.

_is_scalar
Arithmetic types, pointer types, and the nullptr_t type are collectively called scalar types

```


###  Extension type-expression


Syntax:

```
  cast-expression:
    unary-expression
    ( type-name ) cast-expression
    ( type-name ) //<- creates a type expression
```

Type expression can be used with == and != operators. The result is as if the type where compared and the values ignored.

Sample

```c
    int a[2];
    static_assert( a == (int[2]) );

    /* is array of ints? */
    static_assert( _is_array(a) && a[0] == (int) );
```

Making operator ? be decided in compile time, this also could be an alternative to _Generic.

```c

int main()
{
    int a;

    int t1 =
       a == (int) ? 1 : a == (double) ? 2 : 0;

    int t2 =
       _Generic(a, int: 1, double: 2, default: 0);

    typeof( 1 ? (int) : (double)) b;
}
```

### Extension - Ownership checks

See [ownership](ownership.html)

### Extension typename on _Generic

```c
 int main()
{
    const int * const p;
    static_assert(_Generic(p, const int *: 1));

    /*extension*/
    static_assert(_Generic(int, int : 1));
    static_assert(_Generic(typeof(p), const int * const: 1));
}

```

and the lvalue conversion will not happen, allowing
more precise (with qualifiers) type match.

### Extension assert declaration

Standard says "If NDEBUG is defined as a macro name at the point in the source file
where <assert.h> is included, the assert macro is defined simply as

```c
#define assert(...) ((void)0)
```

Cake keeps that.



If NDEBUG is NOT defined cake defines assert as

```c
#define assert(...) assert(__VA_ARGS__)
```

Because Cake can be used as a static analyzer, reading existing headers not previously known by Cake,
it overrides the assert macro to retain information for its use in compiler phases.

Then assert is also a keyword for a built-in expression.
