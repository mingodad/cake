This is a work in progress, both design and implementation. Cake source itself is being used to validate the concepts.

## Abstract
The objective is to statically check code and prevent bugs, including memory bugs. For this task, the compiler needs information that humans typically gather from the context. For example, names like "destroy" or "init" serve as hints, along with documentation and sometimes the implementation itself.

The compiler doesn't read documentation, nor does it operate in the same way as humans. Instead, a formal means of communication with the compiler is necessary. To facilitate this, new qualifiers have been created, and new methods of communication with the compiler have been established.

In the end, we still have the same language, but with a c\_type\_system++ version of C. This c\_type\_system++ can be disabled, and the language remains unmodified.

The creation of these rules follows certain principles, one of which is to default to safety.
In cases of uncertainty, the compiler should seek clarification. While C programmers retain the freedom 
to code as they wish, they must either persuade the compiler or disable analysis in specific code sections.
A human factor must be considered to ensure that annotations do not make the work too boring with 
excessive details. In this regard, selecting defaults that cover the most common cases is crucial.

## Owner Objects

An **owner object** is an object referencing another object and managing its lifetime. 

The most common type of owner objects are pointers, often referred as **owner pointers**. An owner pointer is created with the qualifier owner, as illustrated in Listing 1:

**Listing 1 - Owner Pointer to FILE**

```c
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r"); 
  if (f)
    fclose(f);
}
```

**Note:** The `owner` is actually a macro declared in ownership as _Owner. 

The ownership mechanism has some rules that will be listed gradually throughout the text.

**Rule**: An **owner object** is always the unique owner of the referenced object.

**Rule**: When owner objects are copied the ownership is transfered.

**Rule:** Before the end of its lifetime, owner objects must move the ownership of the objects they own. 

For example, in Listing 2, the ownership of the owner pointer `f` is transferred to `f2`:

**Listing 2 - Assignment of Owner Objects is a Move**

```c  
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
	FILE *owner f2 = f; /*MOVED*/
	if (f2)
       fclose(f2); /*MOVED*/
}
```

Invoking a function `fclose` is analogous to assignment of the argument `f2`, resulting in the transfer of ownership of `f2` to the function parameter.  Listing 3, shows the declaration of `fclose`.

**Listing 3 - Declaration of close**

```c
void fclose(FILE *owner p);
```

### Non-pointer owner objects

We can have other types of **owner objects**. For instance, Berkeley sockets use an integer to identify the socket, as shown in listing 4:

**Listing 4 - Non-Pointer owners objects**

```c
 owner int server_socket =
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
 /*...*/
 close(server_socket);
```

The location and usage of qualifier owner is similar of const qualifier. For pointers it goes after `*`, for this socket sample it can be before int.

### View Objects

A **view object** is an object referencing another object without managing its lifetime. 

**Rule** The lifetime of the referenced object must be bigger than the lifetime of the view object.

The most common view objects are pointers called **view pointers**. 

The view qualifier is not necessary for pointers, since it's the default behavior. When an owner object is copied to a view object, the ownership is not transferred, as shown in Listing 5:

**Listing 5 - Calling Function with View Parameters**

```c
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void use_file(FILE *f) {}

int main() {
    FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
    if (f) {
        use_file(f); /*NOT MOVED*/
        fclose(f);
    }
}
```

When a struct or union have at least one owner object it makes the struct a owner object too.

When a **view** qualifier is used in structs, it makes all members as view objects. Listing 6.
 
**Listing 6 - A view parameter**

```c
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X {   
  char *owner text;   
};  

void f(view struct X x) { /*...*/ }  

int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    f(x); /*NOT MOVED*/    
    free(x.text);
}
```

It is interesting to compare against const qualifier. 
While const adds a qualifier "const" "view" removes the qualifier "owner".

### Returning view pointers.
We cannot return local variables as view pointers.
  
```c
int * f()
{
   int a = 1;
   return &a;
}
int main()
{
  int * p = f();   
  //warning: function returns address of 
  //local variable [-Wreturn-local-addr]
}
```

But we can return static variables and function arguments.

```c
static int a = 1;

int * f()
{   
   return &a;
}
int * f2(int *p) {
   return p;
}

int main()
{
  int * p = f();
  int b = 1;
  p = f2(&b);
}
```

Another sample:

```c   
#include <stdio.h>

int * max(int * p1, int * p2) {  
 return *p1 > *p2 ? p1 : p2;
}

int main(){  
   int * p = NULL;
   int a  = 1;
   {
      int b = 2;
      p = max(&a,  &b);
   }
   printf("%d", *p);
}
```

Examining the implementation reveals that the returned view pointer's lifetime can be that of either 'a' or 'b'. Our goal is to set contracts at the declaration level. Following the concept of ensuring safety by default, we assume that the returned view pointers have the shortest scope, limited to the function call.  
(Cake is not doing this check at this moment) 

### View pointer as struct members
Consider this sample.

```c  
struct X {  
 struct Y * pY;  
};  
struct Y {  
 char * owner name;  
};  
```

An object Y pointed by pY must live longer than object X.  
This check must be done at instantiation.

### Deleting Owner Pointers

**Owner pointers** take on the responsibility of owning the pointed object and its associated memory, treating them as distinct entities. A common practice is to implement a delete function to release both resources, as illustrated in Listing 7:

**Listing 7 - Implementing the delete function**

```c
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};

void x_delete(struct X *owner p) {
  if (p) {
    /*releasing the object*/ 
    free(p->text);
    
    /*releasing the memory*/ 
    free(p); 
  }
}

int main() {
  struct X * owner pX = calloc( 1, sizeof * pX);
  if (pX) {
    /*...*/;
    x_delete( pX); 
  }
}
```

When the object is created on the stack, we can implement a destructor, as shown in Listing 8:

**Listing 8 - Implementing a destructor**

```c
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X {
    char *owner text;
};  

void x_destroy(struct X x) {
    free(x.text);
}  

int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    /*...*/
    x_destroy(x); /*x is moved*/
}
```

However in C, structs are typically passed by pointer rather than by value. To transfer the ownership of an owner object to a pointer, Cake introduces a new qualifier, **obj_owner**. 

A pointer qualified with **obj_owner** is the owner of the pointed object but not responsible for managing its memory.

Listing 9 illustrates how to implement a destructor using a obj_owner pointer parameter.

**Listing 9 - Implementing a destructor using obj_owner**

```c
struct X {
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X {
    char *owner text;
};

void x_destroy(struct X *obj_owner x) {
    free(x->text);
    /*x is not the owner of the memory*/
}

int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    /*more code*/
    x_destroy(&x); /*x is moved*/
}
```

In order to prevent moving from a non owner object, only `address of expressions` to `obj_owner` are allowed. For instance, listing 10 shows we cannot move a view pointer.

**Listing 10 - Non address of expression or owner pointer.**

```c
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X {
 struct Y * p;
};

void y_destroy(struct Y * obj_owner p);

void f(struct X * x) {
  //Error: parameter 1 requires a pointer to owner object
  //Error: pointed object is not owner
  y_destroy(x->p); 
}
```
 
We can copy an owner pointer to an **obj_owner** pointer. In this scenario, only the ownership of the pointed object is transferred, not the memory ownership. Listing 11 illustrates how we can use `x_destroy` in the implementation of `x_delete`.

**Listing 11 - Using `x_destroy` to implement `x_delete`**

```c
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X {
  char *owner text; 
};

void x_destroy(struct X *obj_owner x) {
  free(x->text); 
}

void x_delete(struct X *owner p) { 
  if (p) {
    x_destroy(p); /* *p is moved*/
    free(p);
  }
}

int main() {
   struct X * owner pX = calloc( 1, sizeof * pX);
   if (pX) {
     /*...*/;
     x_delete( pX); 
   }
 } 
```

In C, array types in arguments are pointers. This characteristics is preserved.

To use owner qualifier in array we do. (Just like const)

```c
void f(int a[owner])
{
  free(a);
}
```

But I think this is quite uncommon.


## Static analysis - Checking the rules at compile time  

Let's revisit our first example:

```c
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r"); 
  if (f)
    fclose(f);
}
```

The flow analysis must ensure that when the owner pointer `f` goes out of scope, it does not own any objects. At the end of the scope, `f` can be either null or moved, and both states ensure that there are no remaining resources.

To check the ownership rules, the compiler uses six states:

- uninitialized
- moved
- null
- not-null
- zero
- not-zero
 
We can print these states using the **static_debug** declaration. We can also assert the variable is at a certain state using the **static_state** declaration. Listing 12 shows this usage:

**Listing 12 - Usage of static\_state and static\_debug**

```c
int main() {
 int a;   
 static_state(a, "uninitialized");  
 static_debug(a);
}
```  
  
Output:

```
c:/main.c:4:2: note: static_debug
 4 | static_debug(a);
   | ^~~~~~~~~~~~
 a == "uninitialized"
```
 

As we have just seen, the **uninitialized** state is the state of variables that are declared but not initialized. 

The compiler ensures that we don't read uninitialized objects.

```c
void f1(int i);
int main() {
   int i;
   f1(i); //error: uninitialized object 'i'
}
```

The other situation were variables becomes **uninitialized** is when moving ownership to function parameters. This prevents bugs like double free or use after free.

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X {
  char * owner text;
};

void x_delete(struct X * owner p)
{
    if (p) {
      free(p->text);
      free(p);    
    }
}

void f(struct X * p){}

int main() {   
   struct X * owner p = malloc(sizeof(struct X));
   p->text = malloc(10);
   x_delete(p);
   f(p); //uninitialized object 'p'
}
```

When objects are moved within a local scope, the state is "moved" rather than "uninitialized." The "moved" state is similar to the "uninitialized" state. For instance, it's not possible to move an object that has already been moved.

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X {
  char * owner text;
};

void x_delete(struct X * owner p)
{
    if (p)
    {
      free(p->text);
      free(p);    
    }
}

void f(struct X * p){}

int main() {   
   struct X * owner p = malloc(sizeof(struct X));
   p->text = malloc(10);
  
   struct X * owner p2 = 0;
   p2 = p; //MOVED
  
   f(p); //error: object 'p' was moved
   x_delete(p2);
}

```

The "moved" state was introduced instead of solely relying on the "uninitialized" state because static analysis benefits from having more information on local variables. "Moved" objects may, in some cases, serve as view objects. For example, in listing XX, the x object has been moved to x2, but it is safe to use x as "view" object even after the move.

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X {
  char * owner text;
};

int main() {   
  struct X x = {0};
  //...
  struct X x2 = {0};  
  x2 = x; //MOVED
  free(x2.text);
}
```

Note: The current implementation of cake does not handle all necessary states to ensure the safe usage of moved objects.

A common scenario where uninitialized objects are utilized is when a pointer to an uninitialized object is passed to an "init" function. This situation is addressed by the qualifier **out**.

```c  
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

struct X {
  char * owner text;
};

int init(out struct X *p, const char * text)
{
  //SAFE
  p->text = strdup(text);
}

int main() {   
  struct X x;
  init(&x, "text");  
  free(x.text);
}
  
```

The "out" qualifier is necessary at the caller side and at the implementation.

The caller is informed that the argument must be uninitialized, and the implementation is aware that it can safely override the contents of the object `p->text = strdup(text);` without causing a memory leak.

There is no explicit "initialized" state. When referring to initialized objects, it means the state is neither "moved" nor "uninitialized."

**Rule** By default, the parameters of a function are considered initialized. The exception is created with out qualifier.

For instance, at set implementation we need free text before assignment.

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

struct X {
  char * owner text;
};

int init(out struct X *p, const char * text)
{
  //SAFE
  p->text = strdup(text);
}

int set(struct X *p, const char * text)
{
  free(p->text); //NECESSARY
  p->text = strdup(text);
}

int main() {   
  struct X x;
  init(&x, "text1");
  set(&x, "text2");   
  free(x.text);
}
```

**Rule** All objects passed as arguments must be initialized. The exception is when object is out qualified.

**Rule**: We cannot pass initialized objects to **out** qualified object.

The **null** state means that owner objects are initialized and not referencing any object. Listing 13 shows a sample using owner pointers:

**Listing 13 - Null state**

```c
#include <ownership.h> 

int main() {
 void * owner p = nullptr;   
 static_state(p, "null"); 
}
```  

The **not-null** state indicates that the object is referencing some object.
The state can be a combination of possibilities like **null** and **not-null**. We can check possible combination using "or".
This particular combination **null or not-null** has a alias **maybe-null** as shown in listing 14.

**Listing 14 - not-null and maybe-null state**

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
   void * owner p = malloc(1);
   if (p) {
     static_state(p, "not-null");
   }
   static_state(p, "maybe-null");   
   static_state(p, "null or not-null");
   free(p);
}
```

The **zero** state is used for non-owner objects to complement and support uninitialized checks.

**Rule** Pointer parameters are consider not-null by default. The exception is created using the qualifier **_Opt**.  

To tell the compiler that the pointer can be null, we use the qualifier **_Opt**.

(Currently Cake is only doing null-checks if the -nullchecks option is passed to the compiler, the cake source itself has to move to nullchecks)

**Listing 15 - The zero state**

```c
int main()
{
   int i = 0;
   static_state(i, "zero");   
}
```

**Zero** and **null** are different states. This difference is necessary because, for non-pointers like the socket sample, 0 does not necessarily means null. The compiler does not know the semantics for types that are not pointers. However, you can use **static_set** to override states. In Listing 16, we annotate that server_socket is null, which doesn't mean it is zero but indicates that it is not holding any resources and is safe to return without calling close.



**Listing 16 - Usage of static_set**

```c
  owner int server_socket =
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if (server_socket < 0) {  
     static_set(server_socket, "null");
     return;
  }  
 /*...*/
 close(server_socket);
```

The **not-zero** state is used for non-owner objects to indicate the value if not zero.


Similarly of  **maybe-null**, **any** is a alias for **zero or not-zero** state.

```c
int f();

int main() {   
    int i = f();
    static_state(i, "any");
}

```

By the way, the result of functions are never **uninitialized** by convention.
  
By default, pointers have the state **maybe-null** and other types have the state **any**.

**Rule**: Function never returns uninitialized objects.

Now let's consider `realloc` function.

```c
void * owner realloc( void *ptr, size_t new_size );	
```

In the declaration of `realloc`, we are not moving the ptr. The reason for that is because the `ptr` may or may not be moved. If the function returns NULL, `ptr` was not moved. Listing 17 shows how **static_set** can be used.

**Listing 17 - Using static_set with realloc**

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>
int main()
{
  void * owner p = malloc(1);
  void * owner p2 = realloc(p, 2);
  if (p2 != 0)
  {
     // if p2 != 0 it  means p was moved
     static_set(p, "moved");
     p = p2;
  }    
  free(p);
}
```

Without the `static_set` we have this error   

```
error: memory pointed by 'p' was not released before assignment.
 11 |     p = p2;
```

The state of an object is a combination of all possible states. For instance, let's print and check the state of `f` at listing 17.

**Listing 17 - Flow analysis**

```c  
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
  if (f)
    fclose(f);  
  static_state(f, "uninitialized or null");  
}
```

When objects are moved to functions, the state is  `uninitialized`  that is the worst scenario of what can happens inside the function. When objects are moved inside the same source the state is `moved`.

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r");  
  FILE *owner f2 = f; 
  static_state(f, "moved");  
  fclose(f2);
}  
```


**Rule:** We cannot discard owner objects as showed in listing 18.  

**Listing 18 - owner objects cannot be discarded.**

```c  
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  //error: ignoring the result of owner type
  fopen("file.txt", "r");   
}
```

**Rule:** Before the assignment of owner objects, the compiler checks if the owner object is not holding any resource, as shown in Listing 19:

**Listing 19 - Check before assignment**

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE * owner file = fopen("file.txt", "r");
  
  //error: memory pointed by 'file' was not 
  //released before assignment.  
  file = fopen("file.txt", "r");
}
```

### Function Parameters
For function parameters, the state of the object is initialized by default.

**Listing 20 - States of function parameters**

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <string.h>

struct X {
  char *owner text; 
};

void set(struct  X * x, const char * name) {
  free(x->text);
  x->text = strdup(name);
}

```

When the argument can be uninitialized we use the qualifier _Out.

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <string.h>

struct X {
  char *owner text; 
};

void init(out struct X * x) {
  x->text = strdup("a");
}

void set(struct  X * x, const char * name) {
  free(x->text);
  x->text = strdup(name);
}

```


After calling init the object may or not be initialized.

At  listing 21, we show how **static_set** can be used to set states. 

**Listing 21 - Using static_set**

```c
TODO
```


But when possible we can use assert that works both as static information and runtime check in debug.

Consider the following sample where we have a linked list. Each node has owner pointer to next. The next pointer of the tail of the list is always pointing to null, unless we have a bug. But the compiler does not know `list->tail->next` is null. Using assert we give this inform to the compiler and we also have a runtime check for possible logic bugs.

**Listing 22 shows the usage of assert.** 

```c

#include <ownership.h> 
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node {
 char * owner text;
 struct node* owner next;
};

struct list {
  struct node * owner head;
  struct node * tail;
};

void list_append(struct list* list, struct node* owner node)
{
  if (list->head == NULL) {
      list->head = node;
   }
   else {
      assert(list->tail->next == 0);
      list->tail->next = node;
   }
   list->tail = node;
}
```
  
**Rule:** A non-owner object cannot be copied to a owner object. 

But, the null pointer constant is converted to a null owner pointer. Se listing 23.

**Listing 23 - non owner cannot be copied to owner**

```c
FILE * f();
int main() {  
   FILE * owner file = f(); //ERROR   
   FILE * owner file2 = 0;  //OK
}
```
  
**Rule:** A view pointer parameter cannot leave the scope with moved/uninitialized objects. Listing 24

**Listing 24 - Messing with view parameters**

```c

#include <ownership.h> 
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X
{
  char * owner name;
};

void x_destroy(struct X * obj_owner p)
{
  free(p->name); 
}

struct Y
{
   struct X x;
}

void f(struct Y * p) {
   // parameter 'p' is leaving scoped with a uninitialized
   // object 'p.x.name'
   x_destroy(&p->x);
}
  
int main() {
   struct Y  y = {};
   y.x.name = strdup("a");
   f(&y);
   free(y.x.name);
}
```

However, listing 25 is correct, because before the end of scope states of the parameters are restored.

**Listing 25 - swap function**

```c
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>

struct X
{
  char * owner name;
};

void x_destroy(struct X * obj_owner p)
{
  free(p->name); 
}

void x_swap(struct X * a, struct X * b) {
  struct X temp = *a;
  *a = *b;
  *b = temp;
}
  
int main() {
   struct X x1 = {};
   struct X x2 = {};
  
   x_swap(&x1, &x2);
  
   x_destroy(&x1);
   x_destroy(&x2);
}
```

**Rule:** When objects are moved to functions, they become uninitialized. This prevents bugs like double free. Listing 26. 

```
 int main() {
  void * owner p = malloc(1);
  free(p);
  free(p); //ERROR p is uninitialized
}
```

**Rule:** moved objects cannot be moved. Listing 27.

**Listing 27 - We cannot move a moved or uninitialized object**

```c
int * owner p1 = ...;
int * owner p2 = p1;
int * owner p3 = p1; //ERROR p1 was moved
```

```c
int * owner f(int * owner p1) {
 int * owner p2 = p1;
 return p1; //ERROR p1 was moved
}
```

**Rule:** When coping a owner object to to a view object the compiler must check the lifetime. Listing 28

**Listing 28 - Lifetime check**

```c
void using_file(FILE * f);

struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};  
  
struct X * owner make_owner();  

int main() {
  struct X *p = 0;  
  {
    struct X * owner p2 = make_owner();  
    p = p2; //error p lives longer than p2  
    free(p2);
  }

  using_file(fopen("file.txt", "r")); //ERROR
}
```


**Rule:** Returned objects must be valid.
  

**Listing 34 - Assuming returned objects are valid**

```c
void* owner malloc(unsigned long size);
void free(void* owner ptr);

struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};

struct X * owner f();

int main()
{
   struct X * owner pX = f();
   if (pX) {
     static_state(pX->text, "maybe-null");
   }
}
```


**Rule:** Arguments must be valid.

Exception

`malloc` and `calloc` have  built in semantics.


**Listing 35 - Function Arguments cannot be in a moved or uninitialized state**

```c  
#include <ownership.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>
struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};

void f(struct X * p);

int main() {
   struct X x;
   f(&x); //ERROR
     
   struct X x1 = {0};
   struct X x2 = x1; //MOVED
   f(&x1); //ERROR
}
```

For this reason, an qualifier `out` can be added to allow passing unitalicized objects.

```c
void  free(void* _Owner p);
char* _Owner strdup(const char* s);

struct X {
    char* _Owner s;
};

void init(_Out struct X *  px)
{
    static_state(px, "maybe-null");
    static_state(px->s, "uninitialized");
    px->s = strdup("a");
}

void set(struct X* px, const char* text)
{
    static_state(px, "maybe-null");
    static_state(px->s, "maybe-null");
    free(px->s);
    px->s = strdup(text);
}

int main() {
    struct X x;
    init(&x);
    set(&x, "b");
    free(x.s);
}
```




 

## Ownership Feature Strategy (Inspired by stdbool.h)

If the compiler supports ownership checks and qualifiers such as _Owner, _View, _Obj\_view, etc., it must define  `__STDC_OWNERSHIP__`. 

However, even if the compiler implements ownership, it is not active by default. The objective is to have a smooth transition allowing some files without checks. For instance, a thirty part code inside your project.

For instance, when compiling this file, even if the compiler supports ownership we don't have errors or warnings because the checks are not enabled by default.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  void * p = malloc(1);
}
```

A second define `__OWNERSHIP_H__`, is used to enable ownership.
This define is set when we include `<ownership.h>` at beginning. 

```c
#include <ownership.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  void * p = malloc(1); //error: missing owner qualifier
}
```

The other advantage of having a `<ownership.h>` is because owner is a macro that can be defined as empty in case the compiler does not support ownership, allowing the same code to be compiled in compilers without ownership support. 
  
  
> Currently cake is using the same headers of VS and GCC that are not aware of ownership. For this reason, `ownership.h` itself is declaring malloc etc and the second declaration of malloc inside stdlib.h will not complain with the discrepancy of ownership qualifiers between declarations.
